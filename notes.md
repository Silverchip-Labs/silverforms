# SilverForms

Silverchip's form input library

## Milestones:

will be a different repo for React Native components

### Ready for development

-   Project setup (prettier/eslint, git repo, tsconfig, folder structure, license)
-   First component for template
-   demo setup with example from first component
-   Setup github issues for tasks?

### Ready for first project use / release

-   These components (tested, visible in demo):
    -   TextInput
    -   NumberInput
    -   TextArea
    -   Checkbox (switch?)
    -   CheckboxList
    -   Dropdown
    -   MultiDropdown
    -   MultiMultiDropdown
    -   Radio button
    -   Radio button list
    -   Field ?
-   Figure out error handling. May use Redux for compatibility with current stack/projects.
    with redux, maybe allow importing the library without field validation taking an error prop - import x from silverforms/withoutRedux or something
- Deployed / deployable on npm, with instructions included in repo (for SC devs only) 

### Ready for open source release
- Demo looks nice
- Demo hosted via Github pages 
- Good readme
- Contribution instructions

*   Readme with instructions, props for each component etc.

### Further development

-   Automated testing
-   Continuous Integration
-   Ensure fully accessible, at the very least should be as accessible as default html form inputs (mainly applies to selects/pickers)
